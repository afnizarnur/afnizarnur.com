				I'm an informatics engineering graduate from Telkom University,
				Bandung. As a designer with an engineering background, I feel
				comfortable working with systems and code. That’s why I love
				working on design systems. Throughout my journey until now, I've
				come to understand that design and engineering complement each
				other in building better products.

				When I'm not in front of a screen, I enjoy reading books,
				watching football, or playing video games. I'm especially
				interested to learn more about video games because they are
				fascinating type of craft. I'm also a hobbyist street
				photographer, and I often share my photos on my
				<a href="https://www.instagram.com/afnizar_nur/">Instagram</a>.
				Well, It's a lot of interests!
			</p>
			<p>
				I also enjoy listening to dangdut, keroncong, and campursari
				(It’s traditional music genre from Indonesia). I started
				appreciating these type of music during my college years,
				especially after listening
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didi_Kempot"
					>Didi Kempot</a
				>. As a native Javanese, my cultural background is one of the
				reasons I’m fond of this genre, and I believe that young people
				today should also listen to it because it's part of our culture.
				I also often curate playlists on
				<a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/afnizarnur">Spotify</a>.
