# Astro Development Practices

## Component Development
- Use `.astro` files for components by default
- Implement proper component composition and reusability
- Use Astro's component props for data passing
- Leverage built-in components like `<Markdown />` when appropriate

## Performance Guidelines
- Minimize client-side JavaScript usage
- Use client:* directives strategically:
  - `client:load`: For immediately needed interactivity
  - `client:idle`: For non-critical interactivity
  - `client:visible`: For components that should hydrate when visible
- Implement proper lazy loading for images and assets
- Utilize Astro's built-in asset optimization

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for enhanced type safety
- Define proper interfaces for component props
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow Astro's Style Guide for consistent formatting

## Testing Requirements
- Implement unit tests for utility functions
- Use end-to-end testing with Cypress
- Implement visual regression testing when applicable
