# Astro Project Structure Guidelines

This project follows the recommended Astro project structure:

- `src/`: Main source directory
  - `components/`: Reusable Astro components (.astro files)
  - `layouts/`: Page layouts and templates
  - `pages/`: File-based routing directory
  - `styles/`: Global styles and CSS modules
- `public/`: Static assets
- `astro.config.mjs`: Astro configuration file

Key conventions:
- Components should be in `.astro` files unless framework-specific components are needed
- Pages must be placed in `src/pages/` for automatic routing
- Static assets must be placed in `public/` directory
- Content should be organized using Content Collections in appropriate directories
