## Background

Back in 2013 when I was in vocational high school, I decided to put together a portfolio website to show off my design skills. I didn't have any fancy tools at the time, just good ol' static HTML and CSS. I threw in some Bootstrap framework magic and slapped it on a shared hosting platform. Let me tell you, it was a blast!

Creating that website actually opened up a bunch of job opportunities for me. It was a two-pronged learning experience. First, I wanted to get the lowdown on design systems, from the design and user interface angles. Second, I wanted to understand the developer's side of things while building the site.

Now, I'm sharing this repository mainly for my own reference, but I thought, "Why not toss it up on GitHub for easy access and some peace of mind?" So, feel free to dig into the code and explore what I cooked up back in the day.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/afnizarnur/afnizarnur.com.git
    cd afnizarnur.com
    npm install

    # Start development server
    npm start

    # Build as production-ready
    npm run build
